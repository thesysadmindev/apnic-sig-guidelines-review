# APNIC SIG Guidelines (Revised Draft - Incorporating Policy Alignment & Recommendations)

## 1. Introduction

These guidelines describe the structure, operation, and procedures of the APNIC Special Interest Groups (SIGs). They aim to ensure openness, transparency, and effective participation consistent with the APNIC Policy Development Process (PDP).

SIGs are community forums for discussion and knowledge exchange. They do not constitute formal governance bodies but provide recommendations that may inform policy development and community action.

---

## 2. Purpose

SIGs provide open forums for discussing technical, operational, and policy issues relevant to Internet number resources and the APNIC community. Their recommendations may lead to policy proposals or community actions.

---

## 3. SIG Types and Lifecycle

### 3.1 Core SIGs

**Policy SIG**
* Permanent and integral to APNIC's Policy Development Process
* Cannot be sunset
* APNIC Secretariat is responsible for maintaining engagement and effectiveness
* Facilitates the development of policies for Internet number resource management

**NIR SIG**
* Facilitates coordination with National Internet Registries (NIRs)
* Cannot be sunset without agreement of the NIR community
* NIRs have collective stewardship responsibility for maintaining engagement
* Addresses matters relevant to NIR operations and coordination

### 3.2 Community SIGs

Other SIGs (such as Routing Security SIG, Cooperation SIG) are established based on demonstrated community interest and may be sunset when such interest diminishes.

### 3.3 SIG Formation

New SIGs may be established through an informal community-driven process:
* Emerging topics may be discussed initially through Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions
* If sustained interest is demonstrated, a Working Group (WG) may be formed
* When ongoing need is established, the Executive Council may formally recognize a new SIG by resolution
* Community members may petition the Executive Council to establish a SIG where clear need exists

### 3.4 SIG Sunset

Community SIGs (other than Policy SIG and NIR SIG) may be sunset by Executive Council resolution when community participation indicates the forum is no longer needed, as evidenced by:
* Inability to fill leadership positions over consecutive election cycles
* Consistently low meeting attendance
* Sustained mailing list inactivity
* Completion of the SIG's original purpose

---

## 4. SIG Roles

### 4.1 SIG Chair

* Facilitates meetings and discussions
* Determines whether consensus has been achieved (as defined below)
* Represents the SIG to the APNIC community and Executive Council

### 4.2 SIG Co-Chair(s)

* Support the Chair in all functions
* May act on behalf of the Chair if the Chair is unavailable
* Assist with consensus assessment and community reporting

---

## 5. Consensus Definition

Consensus is **general agreement** as observed by the Chair, in line with the APNIC Policy Development Process (PDP). Consensus does not require unanimity but implies broad support with an absence of sustained opposition. The Chair must:

* Identify and summarize objections
* Ensure all views have been considered
* Declare consensus only when remaining objections are minor and not sustained

If consensus cannot be reached, the proposal may be revised or withdrawn in accordance with the PDP.

## 6. SIG Chair and Co-Chair Elections

### 6.1 Eligibility

* Nominees must reside in the APNIC service region
* Nominees must not be staff of any Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
* Nominees must not have served **two or more consecutive terms** as SIG Chair or Co-Chair (partial terms shorter than one year do not count toward this limit)
* A cooling-off period of one term (two years) applies before re-nomination after reaching the term limit

### 6.2 Corporate Group Limits

* No more than **two individuals** from the same **Corporate Group** may hold SIG Chair or Co-Chair positions simultaneously across all SIGs
* A *Corporate Group* is defined as any set of organizations with a common controlling interest, ownership, or management association
* Each nominee must submit a disclosure attestation identifying any such affiliations
* A transparent review process and right of appeal must be established for disputes regarding Corporate Group determinations

### 6.3 Nomination Process

* Open nomination period announced via APNIC mailing lists
* Nominations must include full name, organization, contact details, and a short statement of interest
* Self-nominations are permitted

### 6.4 Election Process

* Eligible voters: APNIC Members (one vote per Member) and meeting attendees who have attended at least one of the previous eight APNIC conferences
* Voting may occur online and onsite during a defined window
* The candidate receiving the most votes is elected, subject to Corporate Group and eligibility rules

### 6.5 Chair Succession

* When the Chair position becomes vacant, a Co-Chair **may** be nominated as a candidate for Chair
* Preference may be given to experienced Co-Chairs, but nominations remain open to other eligible community members
* This maintains openness while valuing continuity and experience

### 6.6 Term of Office

* Chairs and Co-Chairs serve two-year terms
* Terms are staggered where possible to ensure continuity

### 6.7 Removal and Replacement

# APNIC SIG Guidelines (Revised Draft - Incorporating Policy Alignment & Recommendations)

## 1. Introduction

These guidelines describe the structure, operation, and procedures of the APNIC Special Interest Groups (SIGs). They aim to ensure openness, transparency, and effective participation consistent with the APNIC Policy Development Process (PDP).

---

## 2. Purpose

SIGs provide open forums for discussing technical, operational, and policy issues relevant to Internet number resources and the APNIC community. Their recommendations may lead to policy proposals or community actions.

---

## 3. SIG Roles

### 3.1 SIG Chair

* Facilitates meetings and discussions.
* Determines whether consensus has been achieved (as defined below).
* Represents the SIG to the APNIC community and EC.

### 3.2 SIG Co-Chair(s)

* Support the Chair in all functions.
* May act on behalf of the Chair if the Chair is unavailable.
* Assist with consensus assessment and community reporting.

---

## 4. Consensus Definition

Consensus is **general agreement** as observed by the Chair, in line with the APNIC Policy Development Process (PDP). Consensus does not require unanimity but implies broad support with an absence of sustained opposition. The Chair must:

* Identify and summarize objections.
* Ensure all views have been considered.
* Declare consensus only when remaining objections are minor and not sustained.

If consensus cannot be reached, the proposal may be revised or withdrawn in accordance with the PDP.

### 5.5 Chair Succession

* When the Chair position becomes vacant, a Co-Chair **may** be nominated as a candidate for Chair. Preference may be given to experienced Co-Chairs, but nominations remain open to other eligible community members.

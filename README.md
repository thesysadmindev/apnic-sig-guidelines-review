# APNIC SIG Guidelines Review 2025-2026

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) provide an open public forum to discuss topics of interest to APNIC and the Internet community in the Asia Pacific region. At the APNIC 60 Conference in Viet Nam, a public review into the SIG Guidelines was announced, to ensure that the Guidelines remain current and meet the community's expectations.

Christopher Hawker (AU), Bertrand Cherrier (NC) and Karl Kloppenborg (AU) had submitted a proposal to amend the SIG Guidelines to strengthen and protect the Special Interest Groups. After several discussions online and offline, in-person and remote, it was decided that a whole-of-document review into the Guidelines would be more appropriate. The intent of this is to ensure that the content of the Guidelines is still relevant and they still reflect the the community's expectations.

We invite the community to take part in this review. The SIGs are run by the community, for the community, and this is your chance to have your say in how the SIGs should be guided.
